# Exploratory-data-analysis

## Objective:
The primary objective of this analysis is to conduct a comprehensive exploratory analysis of the "cardiographic.csv" dataset. The goal is to uncover insights, identify patterns, and understand the underlying structure of the data. This involves employing statistical summaries, visualizations, and data manipulation techniques to explore and interpret the dataset effectively.

### Dataset Overview:
The dataset includes various features related to fetal heart rate (FHR) and uterine contractions, with the following variables:

- LB: Baseline Fetal Heart Rate (average FHR over a period)
- AC: Accelerations (indicating fetal well-being)
- FM: Fetal Movements (detected by the monitor)
- UC: Uterine Contractions (impacting FHR patterns)
- DL: Decelerations Late (indicating potential fetal distress)
- DS: Decelerations Short (brief duration decelerations)
- DP: Decelerations Prolonged (long-lasting decelerations)
- ASTV: Percentage of Time with Abnormal Short Term Variability
- MSTV: Mean Value of Short Term Variability
- ALTV: Percentage of Time with Abnormal Long Term Variability
- MLTV: Mean Value of Long Term Variability

## Tasks:
### Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Load the dataset into a DataFrame.
- Address missing values through appropriate methods such as imputation or deletion.
- Correct any inconsistencies in data types (e.g., convert numerical values stored as strings).
- Detect and treat outliers where applicable.

### Statistical Summary
- Provide a detailed statistical summary for each variable, including central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, interquartile range).
- Highlight notable findings and insights from the statistical summary.

### Data Visualization
- Create histograms and boxplots to visualize distributions of numerical variables.
- Use bar charts or pie charts to represent frequencies of categorical variables.
- Generate scatter plots and correlation heatmaps to explore relationships between variables.
- Employ advanced visualization techniques such as pair plots and violin plots for deeper analysis.
  Pattern Recognition and Insights
Identify and discuss correlations between variables and their potential implications.
Examine trends or patterns, especially if temporal data is available.

### Conclusion
- Summarize key insights and patterns discovered through the exploratory analysis.
- Discuss the potential impact of these findings on decision-making and future analyses.
